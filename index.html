                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <h6>To an external observer, the commercial
                            real estate industry might appear slowmoving
                            and conservative. Many industries
                            have experienced technological disruption
                            since the millennium, however software
                            and technology have not started ‘eating
                            the world’ of real estate until relatively
                            recently. So why has it taken until the last
                            couple of years for the word ‘innovation’
                            to become a buzzword in real estate?</h6>
                        <p>This report is a collaboration between Nuveen
                            and MIPIM. It includes our thoughts on the
                            rise of digital disruption and innovation in the
                            commercial real estate industry, and discusses
                            whether real estate is ready to embrace innovation
                            as the industry evolves. We also highlight our
                            favourite ‘MIPIM talk’ topics from this year’s
                            conference. The ‘Mapping World Urbanity’
                            theme placed great emphasis on technology and
                            innovation, sparking a number of insightful
                            conversations, demonstrating that technology is
                            front of mind for those in the industry. We hope
                            this report gives you further insight, and will
                            inspire you to turn ideas into actions. We welcome
                            any feedback you may have and hope to see you at
                            MIPIM 2019.</p>
                        <h4 class="change">Ready for change?</h4>
                        <p>The structural characteristics of real estate as an
                            asset class may not be naturally suited to certain
                            models of innovation and disruption, which
                            emphasise accelerated product iteration, scalability
                            and a ‘disruptive’ mentality. The low velocity of
                            turnover in assets and leases, the heterogeneous
                            nature of properties, and the relatively high cost of
                            experimentation, all present obstacles to successful,
                            persistent innovation. However, obstacles can be
                            overcome. Larger barriers for innovation have
                            resulted from the industry’s culture, which is more
                            malleable. Obstructive elements of this culture
                            include being risk-averse, a lack of alignment
                            between real estate stakeholders, and overall
                            expectations in the industry that the future will
                            be rigidly linear. Fundamentally, real estate is a
                            relatively opaque industry, where connections
                            matter and relationships involve building trust
                            incrementally over time. <br><br>
                            There is a clear link between the characteristics
                            of real estate as an asset class and the industry’s
                            culture, and to a degree this symmetry will
                            undoubtedly prevail. However, some aspects are
                            being challenged. Over the past few years, we have
                            seen increasing expectations for industry players to
                            engage with start-ups, disruptors and the emerging
                            PropTech ecosystem.</p>

                            <p>This year’s innovation forum
                                showcased a range of real estate
                                and built environment start-ups.
                                The ‘innovation trends room’
                                hosted conversations on the impact
                                of technology, innovation and
                                disruption. The quality of speakers
                                and the popularity of these events
                                conveyed the sincerity with which
                                these trends are now being taken.
                                In previous years, innovation areas
                                were attended by people with
                                general interest. This year, attendees
                                meant business, looking for tangible
                                solutions to real-life problems,
                                and were aware that keeping up
                                with technology and innovation
                                is becoming a core component of
                                success in the real estate industry.</p>
